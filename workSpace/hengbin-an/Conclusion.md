  ### Prototype of the project

  This project is about the design of pet website functions. Our team members (a total of five people) are arranged to design a series of functions for the online website of the owner of a pet shop, making the online website more attractive to customers and improving the owner or buyer The ease of going to use the site. 

  ### Discussion of new features for the project

  In order to improve the convenience and visibility of the website, after a group discussion, we decided to add the following functions. These functions take into account the convenience of the store manager for warehouse management, as well as the needs of customers to filter pets and query pet allowances.

  To meet these needs, we have made three pages. One is to show which pets are not yet sold. This interface also adds a filter function. From the customer's point of view, it is convenient for customers to complete pet queries based on certain conditions, such as pets. There are five species in our group, including cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, and birds. Our group also set up five types of pet personalities, namely, lively, brave, lazy, docile, and cold. This can largely satisfy customers' selection of pets, and at the same time improve retrieval efficiency and transaction rate. Obviously, an operating website that is not user-friendly to customers is difficult to leave customers to continue using and recommend to others.

  The second interface is to display animals that have been sold. This interface is simply a display of animals that have been sold. Our team surveyed that the consumer psychology of customers almost determines their shopping behavior. Consumer psychology is the consumer The sum of consumer psychology and purchase psychology, and the psychological process of consumer purchase behavior is often three processes, including the process of cognition of the product, the emotional and emotional process, and the will process. For a customer who does not have a clear shopping goal, the herd effect will greatly occupy the customer's process of understanding the product and the process of will, which will lead to a perceptual cognition. Pets that are sold more are more suitable for feeding. It is more appropriate to wait for a series of judgments. Obviously, when customers only want to buy pets, but there is no specific pet standard, the benefit of this page is to guide customers to spend, and customers are often willing to pay for pets with high sales, thereby increasing the income of the store manager In addition, the store manager can also check the high-selling pets in a timely manner and supplement the categories in the warehouse. This is a win-win situation.

  The design concept of the third interface is to improve the convenience of the store manager’s pet website management. From the store manager’s point of view, to maintain the operation of this pet website, it is necessary to introduce new pets and provide them to customers to choose from, and at the same time customers purchase For pets, the store manager should set the status of the pet as soon as possible to prevent conflicts caused by multiple users buying the same pet. There are three pet states that the store manager can change on this page. They are sold. pending, available, so that customers can make correct choices and purchases, and maintain the normal operation of the pet website.

  ### The final performance of the project

  ### Whether the expected goal has been achieved

  The expected goal of our group is to improve the ease of use of pet websites, thereby increasing the transaction rate on pet websites. At present, the several website functions added after our group discussion have achieved the expected goal from the test, but considering each group meeting, the members will put forward their own ideas and opinions, and then we will discuss the feasibility together, so our Functional iterations have always existed. We also know that for the store manager himself, setting up an administrator login system is more secure and necessary for the pet website, so we will make a simple permission login system to make this pet website It is safer and more in line with the actual situation.

  ### Further optimize the direction analysis of the project

  ### Reflection on group practice

  We will discuss the feasibility of the new ideas mentioned in the group meeting of the team. As long as it is feasible, we will try our best to achieve it. However, the process of this practice does encounter some obstacles. For example, there is a function that is very good, but because we multiple types of pet types are set, and there are many copies of imported pet data. 
  
  This leads to the fact that if you want to implement this function, then these data must be set with corresponding codes. One is more cumbersome, and second, bear in mind it's also a live API provided, anyone can post, so it's very twitchy. This may cause the data to disappear.

  ### Reflection on teamwork

  In addition, our team is very active to communicate about this project, and the number of group meetings is more frequent, so that everyone can clearly know the part of the task that they are responsible for, and have a function of the code part of the new project. A clear understanding will help us write and unify the report.
