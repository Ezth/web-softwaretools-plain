Meeting log 2
Date: 2021 July 29th 
People: Zejia Liu, Jian Chen, Hengbin An, Tramell Li, Tao He.
Discussion:
(1)	Update each one’s progress now and the web building process. Zejia showed us the early form of our web. Main page: search bar on the top with pets pictures listed below.
(2)	Clarify and discuss features again: shop owner can add or modify status of the pets. 
For the sold webpage, we can do a ranking which ranks the popularity of different categories. This aims at stimulate purchase. 
Jump function between sold page and search page: If user find some categories they like in sold page they can click on the link and be directed to pets under that category in available items. 
(3)	Discuss the reason for setting ID as must fill in: ID has not been set as primary key in the database. We designed that to be self-increasing but not we need to insert ID by hand. 
(4)	Some other details on the webpage: footnotes, the photos of cats and dogs.
(5)	Discuss common web building process and why we do not add “others” in categories or tags. Categories and tags should be pre-defined.
(6)	Discuss the final presentation mode and if we can do the log in system & real time log in during the video presentation.
