## Discussion
1. Potential features to be added:
* Find pet by categories (e.g. dog, cat, rabbit, hamster)
* Add pet pictures & add new pets 
* Filter function: e.g. filter by tags (pets characteristics e.g. outgoing, energetic, big, brave, docile, clever……)
* Ranking function: e.g. rank by popularity (number of times purchased), price 

2. Go through the APIs and database. See which APIs we could use and link API to our designed features. See which features we cannot realize based on the backend materials. For instance, there is no price in database so we might not be able to add the feature of ranking by price. 
3. Discuss whether this webpage is shown to customers or pet shop owner? Designed in benefits for shop owner or consumers?
4. 	Cooperation method: Git & Github    release branch 
Use markdown   
Github: workspace we each upload our work to folder named after our names under workspace folder
Tell Zejia what we uploaded during each meeting and he will merger useful things to final report sector in main branch.

5. The current database structure is not very ideal. Maybe we can add our own tags and pictures in through POST API later on.
